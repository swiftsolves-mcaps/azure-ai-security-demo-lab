## ‚ú® Overview

> [!WARNING]  
> This repo is still under development, and has not yet reached v1.0 release.

This repo provides automation to deploy AI Workloads on Azure using Azure OpenAI and supporting resources, and to enable key Azure Security configurations. This automation uses the fantastic work built by the [Azure Search OpenAI Demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo) samples repo and builds additional security components. We swap the frontend to use Azure App Service, and also enable the flags for conversation history, which requires Cosmos DB and Entra ID.

After we deploy the *azure-search-openai-demo* environment, we run the automation to leverage some bolt-on, and some build-in security:

- Deploy Azure Front Door + WAF in front of Azure App Service
- Enable Azure Defender for App Service
- Enable Azure Defender for Storage
- Enable Azure Defender for AI
- Enable Azure Defender for Cosmos DB

## üîê Security features summary

| Component | Purpose | AI Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| Azure Front Door + WAF | Global edge entry (anycast), TLS offload, path-based routing; WAF managed rules (OWASP), optional bot/rate limits | Protects AI app ingress and mitigates prompt injection/abuse at the edge |
| Defender for Storage | On-upload malware scanning, sensitive data discovery (PII/PCI/PHI), anomaly detection; alerts in Defender for Cloud | Safeguards training data, embeddings, and user uploads |
| Defender for AI | Model, and prompt-aware threat detection for Azure OpenAI; monitors misuse, exfil attempts, and known attack patterns | Detects abuse/attacks specific to AI workloads |
| Defender for App Service | Runtime threat detection for App Service: suspicious requests, process anomalies, brute-force and exploitation attempts | Monitors the AI app runtime and API surface |
| Defender for Cosmos DB | Threat detection: SQL injection, anomalous access, data exfiltration patterns on databases/containers | Protects chat history and semantic cache |

## Instructions

### üöÄ Quick Start (3 steps)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open in Codespaces or VS Code Dev Container by clicking a badge above.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy the sample from a terminal in the dev container (regions are selected interactively).

```bash
chmod +x *.sh; ./deploy-sample-and-secure.sh --env azure-ai-search-demo
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Apply security hardening (includes Front Door + WAF by default)

```bash
./azureAISecurityDeploy.sh
 ```

*If azd environment resource group auto-detection fails, the script will prompt for the resource group name. You can still run it explicitly with `./azureAISecurityDeploy.sh <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>`.*


> [!NOTE]  
> üí° If prompted for subscription-wide enablement (App Services or Cosmos DBs), you may accept to enable them now. This creates a local state file `.defender_state.env` so cleanup can revert the change later if desired.

## üìù To-Do List
 
- [ ] Create a real architecture diagram that's not ASCII.
- [ ] Add APIM with [Defender for APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-apis-introduction)
- [ ] Integrate [Data-Aware Threat Protection and Security Posture](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-data-aware-security) features
- [ ] Add Azure Front Door + WAF
- [ ] Build SQL data source and enable [Defender for SQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-sql-introduction)
- [ ] Deploy Microsoft Purview for Data Classification, and DLP
- [ ] Integrate Azure AI Content Safety in [application code](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview)
- [ ] Add [Data and AI security dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/data-aware-security-dashboard-overview)
- [ ] Add user guides for walking through verifying each aspect of the solution's security measures

## üßπ Cleanup / Deletion

Run the cleanup script from this repo:

```bash
./cleanup.sh azure-ai-search-demo
```

What it does:

- Purges the entire azure-search-openai-sample app
- Removes the additional Azure Front Door deployment
- Offers to revert any subscription-wide Defender plan changes that were enabled by the secure step (App Services, Cosmos DBs) back to Free.
